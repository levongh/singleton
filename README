Intent:
    Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
    Encapsulate "just-in-time" or "initialization on first use"

The Problem:
    Application needs one, and only one, instance of an object.
    Additionaly, lazy initialization and blobal access are necessary
